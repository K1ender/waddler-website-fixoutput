There's no need to manually declare a primary key on your object types.

All object types automatically contain a property id of type UUID that's required, globally unique, readonly, and has an index on it. 

The id is assigned upon creation and cannot be changed.

```typescript copy

(async () => {
  await sql`
      CREATE TYPE default::users {
              create required property name:str;
              create required property age:int16;
              create required property email:str;
        };
    `.query();
  // `.query()` tells Waddler to use the client.query method, which can execute statements such as `CREATE TYPE`.
  // The default option is `.querySQL()`, which uses client.querySQL to run SQL queries.
})()
```
